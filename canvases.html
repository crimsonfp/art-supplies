<center><p> There is much less of a variety in canvses as there is in paper. Most canvases have the same, slightly coarse surface in order to grip onto paint. A majority are backed and supported by wood framing, yet there are other options of wood, plastic, and metal. Wood, however, is by far the most common and widely reccomended. Framing is typically sperate from the canvases and added after the painting is complete. This is the same with matting, the overlay that sets a piece of artwork in place. Matting and framing are both completely optional, and they are implemented purely for aesthetic reasons. </p>
