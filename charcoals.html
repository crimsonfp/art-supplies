<center><p>Charcoals are much less common of a medium, and they are typically only used by intermediate artists and above. They can be difficult to use, as even in pencil form, they are very different from graphite. Infact, one should attempt to avoid mixing charcoal and graphite, as the two mediums leave different residues, lusters, tones, and textures. Although they may look similar in hand, they couldn't be more different in practice. With charcoals, you can acheive a much darker black pigment. This can help with the depth of an artpiece, as a larger variety of tones makes a piece much more striking. When using charcoals not in pencil form, be sure to take advantage of the chalk-like edge and try to create a wide shade. Tools are also very useful when dealing with charcoal, so make sure to check out some pallet knives, sponges, blending stumps, and mechanical erasers!</p>
